# PythonProcessScheduler
Created in Systems 2 at Miami University to model different methods of process scheduling.

Segregate Scheduling, Round Robin, Fork-Join, Assignment 3 I believe were all files for individual assignments modeling different process scheduling methods. Some files were lost as they were renamed without saving the previous itteration.

These models were submitted each week or each other week (depending on time constraints/complexity). All coded in python and basic frame work was given to me by my professor. Each assignment I updated the components file and remodeled to represent that assignment's process scheduling model.

This project creates a buch of packets and sends them to different nodes which then either recieve the packet as a final destination or it sends it off to another node as a final destination. Packets contained various data stored with in them and were changed weekly containing relevant data.
