# PythonProcessScheduler
Created in Systems 2 at Miami University to model different methods of process scheduling.

Segregate Scheduling, Round Robin, Priority, Fork-Join, Assignment 3 I believe were all files for individual assignments modeling different process scheduling methods.
These models were submitted each week or each other week (depending on time constraints/complexity). All coded in python and basic frame work was given to me by my professor. Each assignment I updated the components file and remodeled to represent that assignment's process scheduling model.

This project creates a buch of packets and sends them to different nodes which then either recieve the packet as a final destination or it sends it off to another node as a final destination. Packets contained various data stored with in them and were changed weekly containing relevant data.
